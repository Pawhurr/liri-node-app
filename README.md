# liri-node-app

## Welcome to the Liri-Node-App.

This node app will allow you to search for upcoming concerts for artists you like, song information from Spotify, or look up the plot and release date of your favorite movie.  To use, simply begin by typing out `node liri.js` followed by one of four commands: `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song`, `movie-this`, or `do-what-it-says`.

`concert-this` followed by an artist name will return information on upcoming tour dates.
`spotify-this-song` followed by a song name will return information about the song, artist, and album.
`movie-this` followed by a movie name will return a number of pieces of information including plot and actors.
`do-what-it-says` randomly chooses from some preset commands.
